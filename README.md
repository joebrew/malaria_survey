## Background

The WHO GMP has acknowledged that it "needs to take an official position on how and under what timeline malaria eradication could be achieved". Such a position could inform policy, and plays a crucial role in the economic analysis of the expected value of malaria control inteventions. Since no position has been taken, we propose using the “wisdom of [expert] crowds”. Aggregated expert opinion enables estimation of the expected value of eradication.

## Objectives

In a systematic survey of experts in the fields of neglected tropical diseases and malaria, we will query perceptions regarding the feasibility and time-frame of eradication, as well as the perceived gaps and chief areas that need attention in order for eradication to occur. We will report on aggregate results, and our analysis will be broken down by disease, researcher academic discipline, impact and years of experience. 
Our principal objective is to measure the perceived likelihood/feasibility and time-frame of eradication of certain neglected tropical diseases and malaria among those who are professional researchers of those respective diseases, at a larger scale than any previous study. Our secondary objective is to examine the relationship between the perceived likelihood/feasibility of eradication of diseases with the respective attention allotted to them in both the popular and academic literature. Our tertiary objective is to establish which specific areas of knowledge are lacking through an examination of researcher characteristics (academic discipline, geography, etc.) insofar as those characteristics are associated with differential perceptions regarding time-to-eradication.

## Methods and Design

We will “webscrape” from PubMed the authors, abstracts, and journal information of all articles related to disease X using standardized search terms. We will then send emails to all first, last, and corresponding authors (whose addresses can be located), asking 2 simple questions:

1. In your opinion, how many years will it be until disease X is eradicated? (0-99+)

2. Please rank the following ten areas in order of where attention is most needed in order to achieve eradication (10 = attention most needed; 1 = attention least needed).


These questions can also be answered via an online survey: http://goo.gl/forms/Ib80IwgwQY 


We will then compile a database which links researcher meta-information (% and number of publications in top-decile journals, publication quantity, geography of institution, geography of research focus, gender, academic discipline) with their surveyed attitudes regarding eradication (years-to-eradication and ordered ranking of factors). 


The design of this study is typical, but this study is noteworthy in two areas: (1) its scale (by using automated web-scraping, emailing, and surveying, we will reach the maximum number of experts), and (2) its democratic approach (we assume that the more experts’ opinions reflected, the closer we are to approximating the “truth”). Our results will be of value not only to the scientific community, but also to policy-makers and public health practitioners. By gauging and synthesizing the “wisdom of (informed) crowds”, we aim to establish a barometer of scientific opinion in a manner that is fully reproducible.
